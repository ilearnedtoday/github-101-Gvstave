# What I learned today.🧑‍💻

Github is a tool for tracking the progress of your works, collaborating and sharing them. This markdown file is about connecting the dots of what I learned 🚀 and the things am still confused about in relation to getting started with Github.

## TakeDowns ✍️

After going through the Github introduction, below 👇 is a brief explanation of what I learned.

### :octocat: Git 🆚 Github
* Git: Is a terminal based **Distributed Version Control System** that is used as a tool to store, track, manage changes to the version of a project and collaborate with other contributors during the software development process of that project.
* Github: Is a web-based tool that host git repositories. It provides a graphical user interface to manipulate the functionality of git and expand to add other functionalities.

### :octocat: Some Github terms
* Cloning: Refers to creating a local copy of a repository hosted on the GitHub platform. When you clone a repository, you create an identical copy of that repository on your own local machine, allowing you to collaborate with other contributors, make changes, and commit your local version of those changes to the original repository.
* Issue: In Github issues are basically a description of bugs, implementation details, items to include in the project, and features that are within that project.
* Pull request: To contribute to a project an individual can propose changes to the project through a pull request, the changes can then be reviewed by other contibutors before being emerged into the main codebase.

## Disputes 🤔

Below 👇 are some of the issues that are still boggling my mind.

* In as much as I have modified my file I still have challenges with the styling conventions of a markdown file.
* The purpose of starring a repository, is it [liking](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_like_button&ved=2ahUKEwiczPDOi_aHAxXMVkEAHY58FRcQFnoECEoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3ou_8SVcrzhcV2TVe2lRZ8) a repo or it's just [starring](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars)?
* I still can not properly differentiate **commit** from **push**.
